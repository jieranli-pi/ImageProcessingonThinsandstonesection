# Image processing

This project contains the codes and (maybe) some of the test data for my Bachelor Thesis, which is mostly about image processing on the microscopic scan of sandstone thin sections.
For this project, I use Python as my programming language.

Interesting topics including:

1) Thresholding, and the impact of threshold value on the porosity
2) Merging tiles
3) Classifying areas/shape index of pores/grains for sandstones
4) finding the margin between connected objects(grains) and cut those
